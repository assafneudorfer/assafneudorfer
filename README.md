# Hi, I'm Assaf 👋

**AI Backend Engineer**  
ML Ops • Distributed Systems • Python

I build **production-grade backend systems** that power AI applications — from model-serving pipelines to scalable, fault-tolerant APIs.

---

## 🧠 What I focus on
- Designing **distributed backend systems** for AI-heavy workloads
- **MLOps & model serving** (deployment, monitoring, scaling)
- High-performance **Python** services
- Integrating AI coding agents into real-world development workflows

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (expert)
- **Backend:** FastAPI, async systems, REST
- **Distributed Systems:** event-driven architectures, scaling, reliability
- **MLOps:** model serving, inference pipelines, automation
- **Infra:** Docker, Kubernetes, cloud-native patterns
- **AI Tools:** Claude Code (daily driver)

---

## 🤖 How I work with AI
I actively use **Claude Code** as a development partner for:
- Designing system architectures
- Writing and refactoring production code
- Accelerating complex backend and ML workflows

I care deeply about **correctness, clarity, and maintainability** — AI is a force multiplier, not a shortcut.

## 📌 Currently
- Building AI-first backend systems
- Exploring scalable model-serving patterns
- Deepening MLOps and distributed systems design
